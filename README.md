# Positron Project

## Goals

Build, package, and distribute native Rust Apps on
Linux, Windows, Android, OSX and iOS (listed in order of implementation priority).

Apps can include runtime dependencies which are distributed and updated separately.

A webview is provided which can host WebAssembly.

Interaction between WebAssembly and native Rust modules is ergonomic.

App instances running on different devices can collaborate together via ad-hoc and server-assisted
mechanisms to share resources like compute or storage.

Tooling should support both users and developers (e+).
